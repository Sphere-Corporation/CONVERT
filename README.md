# THIS REPOSITORY HAS BECOME READ-ONLY. PLEASE READ BELOW.

## WHY ?

The development of the CONVERT toolset will continue, but it has been combined with the [TOOLCHAIN repository](https://github.com/Sphere-Corporation/TOOLCHAIN.git).

This brings together the full build toolchain for SPHERE-1 executables and ROM images, and the conversion tools formerly hosted here into one repository.

Therefore, this repository has become read-only/archived as at 12-JAN-2025. 
<hr>


### CONVERT
A set of tools to convert from various SPHERE-1 formats to other SPHERE-1 formats.

These comprise:
  convertEXE:   converts assembled 6800 code to several Sphere-1 compatible formats
  convertROM:   converts a raw binary SPHERE-1 ROM image to an ORB-compatible format

## Installation

### Prerequisites (for the full tool set)
 
 * Install `Python 3.x` - versions above 3.9 are currently supported
 * Install "[click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/)" by typing `pip3 install click`
 * Install `bin2sphere`
    * Clone [Ben Zotto's bin2sphere](https://github.com/bzotto/bin2sphere) repository
    * Folow the build instructions in the [README](https://github.com/bzotto/bin2sphere/blob/main/README.md)
    * Ensure the built executable is located in the same folder/directory as the `convertEXE` from this repo

> **_NOTE:_**  
_There is a version of `bin2sphere` included in this repo dated October 9th 2023. It is recommended that to ensure the latest software is being used that you follow the installation instructions for `bin2sphere` above._

### convertEXE package

 * Clone the repository and ensure that the path is on your search path.
 * Test the installation by typing 
 `convertEXE --version`
 * If you see the following: 

 `convertEXE (Version 1.0.3): Convert MC6800 assembled code into Sphere-1 loadable package and other formats.` 

`(c) Andrew Shapton 2023, Portions (c) Ben Zotto 2023` all is well.

**OR**

`convertROM --version`

If you see the following:

`convertROM (Version 1.2): 
Converts a Sphere ROM binary file into a form suitable for the SPHERE-Firmware emulator`

 Note that the versions *could* be slightly different from these shown, if small bugfixes have been introduced.
 
 If not, check that the repository is cloned correctly and that the location is definitely on your search path.

## convertEXE
### Formats supported

 * Virtual Cassette for Ben Zotto's Virtual Sphere-1 emulator
 * Javascript for manually embedding into the Virtual Sphere-1 emulator
 * Virtual Cassette "V2" format for automatically embedding into the Virtual Sphere-1 emulator (experimental)
 * .WAV file for storing as a "true' cassette audio file

  -f, --format TEXT   Specify the output format. (required)
  -e, --ext TEXT      Extension for output file.
  -b, --base TEXT     Base address of ROM.
  -c, --comment TEXT  < 80 characters of comment for the ROM image (in
                      quotes).
  -s, --silent        Silent (no output).
  -l, --license       Show the license (MIT).
